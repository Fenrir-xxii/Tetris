It contains 6 standart tetris figures.  
The aim in Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. 
You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. 
The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning.

whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.
